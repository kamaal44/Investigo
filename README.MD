# Why Investigo?
Investigo is trying to build our own database while keeping compatibility with Sherlock.
This is because even though Sherlock project contains a vast database, adult sites are forbidden.

Furthermore, Investigo is more than twice as fast as the original implementation!

# TODO
## Manifesto
Investigo is another implementation of Sherlock. Accordingly, I would like not to make a competition with Sherlock.

 - [ ] Avoid deep packet inspection
 - [ ] Support Tor
 - [ ] Implement regex check
 - [x] Command-line arguments
 - [ ] Add tests

# Site support
Investigo uses Sherlock's database.

Accordingly, If you want to add sites to Investigo, make a PR to [Sherlock project](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock). Or if you want to add prohibited sites for Sherlock, make an issue or a PR to this repository!
